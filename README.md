# Mobile-Agent-SIEM
a Mobile Agent-based SIEM for event normalization.

The following Java classes are snapshots of the code used to provide mobile agent-based SIEM systems for event normalization.
The implementation was done using JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) to propose a multi-agent system which executes the
standardization process using mobile agents.

I will add more details pretty soon..
